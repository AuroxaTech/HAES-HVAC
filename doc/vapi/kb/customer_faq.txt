# HVAC-R Finest - Customer FAQ

**For Vapi Knowledge Base**  
*Non-sensitive information only*

---

## Call purpose routing

Ask right after the greeting: "Are you calling for: (1) Service or repair, (2) Equipment replacement, (3) Scheduled maintenance, or (4) A question I can answer?"

**After they answer, route to the correct flow:**
- **Service or repair** → Go to **Service Request Flow**
- **Equipment replacement** → Go to **Quote Request Flow**
- **Scheduled maintenance** → Go to **Maintenance / Tune-Up Flow** (six-question assessment; do not skip)
- **Question** → Use knowledge base to answer; use billing_inquiry, check_appointment_status, etc. as needed

---

## Pre-finalize confirmation

Before completing any appointment or service request, repeat the following back to the customer and ask for confirmation:

**Fields to repeat:** Name, address, phone number, service type (or problem description), and if scheduling: the scheduled date and time.

**Sample script:** "Just to confirm — I have [Name] at [Address], phone [number], for [service type / problem]. [If scheduling: Your appointment is [day], [date] at [time].] Is all of this correct?"

Only after the customer says yes (or confirms) should you call the tool to create the service request or schedule the appointment.

---

## Returning customer — call-start lookup (#4)

**At the very start of the call**, before or right after the call-purpose question, call the lookup_customer_profile tool with **only the caller's phone number** (use the number from the call; address is not needed for this first lookup). If the tool returns a profile (found: true, with name and partner_id), **greet the customer by name immediately** (e.g. "Hi [Name], thanks for calling HVAC-R Finest. Are you calling for…") and use that profile for the rest of the call. Do not ask for name or address again unless confirming. If no profile is found, proceed as a new customer. This enables "recognized phone → greeting by name" so returning customers are recognized before the warranty question.

---

## Caller ID — phone confirmation

When collecting the **caller's** contact (tenant path), you have their phone from the call. Do not ask "What's your phone number?" — confirm instead: "I have your number as [number]. Is that the best number to reach you?" If yes, use it; if they give a different number, use that. For **property management** you are collecting the **tenant's** phone (not the caller's), so ask for the tenant's number as usual.

---

## Property management vs tenant

**When to ask:** In the service/repair flow, ask immediately after acknowledging the customer's problem (right after Step 1). Ask: "Are you calling as a tenant or as part of the property management team?" Do not skip this; the answer determines what information you collect and who gets notified.

**If tenant (caller is the resident):**
- The caller is the tenant. Collect the caller's own name, phone number, and service address (they are the resident at the property).
- Pass caller_type: "tenant" in the tool. Post-appointment SMS/email goes to the tenant; property management is added to the notification list so PM is notified.
- Then continue with standard flow: urgency, diagnostic questions, "Have we provided service or warranty work at your house before?", lead source, confirm, two time slot options.

**If property management (PM) (caller is PM, not the resident):**
- The caller is scheduling on behalf of a property. Do not treat the caller as the tenant.
- **Streamlined scheduling** means: collect (1) tenant's name and phone (for the unit), (2) service address, (3) PM company name and PM contact phone/email. Skip "Have we provided service or warranty work at your house before?" for the PM caller; optional to ask about the tenant's service history at that address if relevant.
- **Multiple properties:** After completing one service request or appointment, ask: "Do you need to schedule another property?" If yes, collect the next property's tenant name, tenant phone, address, and problem; then offer two time slots again. Create a separate lead/appointment per property. If no, proceed to confirmation and close.
- Pass caller_type: "property_management" in the tool. Only the PM contact gets post-appointment SMS/email (no tenant notification).

**Both paths:** When scheduling, offer exactly two time slot options. Both tenant and PM callers receive two slots to choose from.

---

## Lead source (How did you hear about us?)

Before finalizing, ask: "How did you hear about us?" Use the answer to set the lead source when calling create_service_request (or schedule_appointment if that flow creates a lead). Accepted options (normalize to these when possible):
- **Google** — search, online
- **Referral** — friend, family, neighbor, realtor
- **Social media** — Facebook, Instagram, etc.
- **Previous customer** — used us before, existing customer
- **Other** — anything else

Pass the normalized value in the tool's lead_source parameter.

---

## Two-slot scheduling flow (schedule_appointment)

When the customer wants to book an appointment, use the schedule_appointment tool in two steps. Do not offer a single slot; always offer two options and let the customer choose.

**Do NOT ask** "What type of maintenance?" or "Do you have a preferred time window?" before the first call. Call the tool first with name, phone, address; the backend returns two options without those.

**Step 1 — Get two options:** Call schedule_appointment with customer_name, phone, address (and any other details you already have: email, property_type, caller_type, confirmed_partner_id). Do NOT pass chosen_slot_start. Do not ask the customer for service_type or preferred_time_windows before calling. The backend will return a message like "I have [Day A at Time A] or [Day B at Time B]. Which works better for you?" and include next_available_slots. Say that to the customer and wait for their choice.

**Step 2 — Book the chosen slot:** When the customer says which slot they want (e.g. "The first one" or "Tuesday at 10"), call schedule_appointment again with the same customer/address/details as in Step 1. Pass the chosen slot using **either** (a) chosen_slot_start = the ISO datetime from the Step 1 response's next_available_slots[].start, **or** (b) preferred_date = that slot's date (YYYY-MM-DD) and preferred_time = that slot's time (e.g. 10:00). The backend will then create the appointment at that time.

**Summary:** First call = no slot params → get two options. Second call = chosen_slot_start OR preferred_date + preferred_time → book that slot. One tool, two calls when scheduling.

## Commercial — urgency and property type

**Urgency (#13):** At the start of commercial calls, ask: "Is this an urgent issue requiring immediate attention, or can it be scheduled at your convenience?" Set priority and timeline accordingly. Pass urgency into the lead/request.

**Property-type questions (#14):** After the customer says their property type (hotel, warehouse, or school), ask the questions below for that type. Do NOT ask generic questions like "Is this urgent?" or "What problem are you experiencing?" — ask the property-type-specific questions.

**Hotel — ask these questions (one at a time):**
- Which room(s) are affected?
- What floor level?
- Is there ladder access? Where?
- Who should the technician check in with?
- Is this affecting guest comfort or operations?

**Warehouse — ask these questions (one at a time):**
- Where is ladder access?
- What's the ceiling height?
- What type of HVAC equipment is it (e.g. rooftop units, split)?
- How many units are affected?
- Is the issue affecting operations or safety?

**School — ask these questions (one at a time):**
- Which areas are affected (e.g. gym, classrooms, admin)?
- What type of system (e.g. rooftop, split, VRF)?
- Do you prefer school hours or after-hours for the visit?
- What are the security or check-in procedures for contractors?

**Commercial checklist (#16):** For every commercial call, ensure all are collected (use KB for full checklist): urgency; property type; ladder access and location; equipment type and quantity; point of contact; access restrictions; business hours; safety considerations.

---

## Diagnostic questions (service/repair calls)

After identifying the customer's intent, ask the relevant diagnostic questions by issue type. One question at a time.

**Water leaks:**
- Where do you see the water — near the indoor unit, outdoor unit, or somewhere else?
- Is the water inside the house or outside?
- Where exactly do you see the water (under the unit, on the wall, from a pipe)?

**Unit not working:**
- Is the issue with the indoor unit, outdoor unit, or both?
- When did you first notice it wasn't working?
- How long have you lived in the home / has it ever worked there?

**Cooling or heating (noise, not cooling/heating):**
- Are you hearing any unusual noises (grinding, banging, squealing)?
- When did you first notice the problem?
- Has this happened before?

**Appliance (fridge, etc.):**
- Is it electric or gas?
- What type of appliance (refrigerator, freezer, walk-in)?
- Describe what's happening (not cooling, ice buildup, etc.).

---

## Maintenance / Tune-Up Flow

When the customer calls for **scheduled maintenance** or a **tune-up**, use this flow instead of the Service Request Flow.

### Step 1: Acknowledge
"Great, let's get your maintenance scheduled. I just have a few quick questions to help our technician prepare."

### Step 2: Caller type and property type
Ask: "Are you calling as a tenant or as part of the property management team?"
Then: "Is this for a home or a business?"
For what to collect (tenant vs PM), see **Property management vs tenant**. Then continue below.

### Step 3: Six-Question Maintenance Assessment (REQUIRED — DO NOT SKIP)

Ask these questions **ONE AT A TIME**. Do not skip this step.

1. "How has your HVAC system been operating lately?"
   - If they mention issues, probe deeper before moving on.
   - If no issues, say "Great!" and continue.

2. "Have you noticed any hot or cold spots in different rooms?"

3. "Have you experienced unusually high electricity bills recently?"

4. "Does your home feel too sticky during summer or too dry during winter?"

5. "Has anyone in your household experienced allergy issues or increased sickness lately?"

6. "Have you noticed an increase in dust around the house?"

### Step 4: Air Filter Size (Optional but helpful)
"Do you happen to know your air filter size? If you do, we can bring a replacement."
- If they know it, note it.
- If they say "I'm not sure" or "No," say "No problem, the technician can check when they arrive."

### Step 5: Contact Information
Collect name, phone (confirm from caller ID — see **Caller ID — phone confirmation**), and service address — one at a time.

### Step 6: Confirm and Schedule
- Ask "How did you hear about us?" (lead source — see **Lead source**).
- Repeat back all details.
- Ask "Is all of this correct?"
- Offer exactly TWO time slot options (see **Two-slot scheduling flow**).
- Book the chosen slot with schedule_appointment.
