It’s an AI Daily Operating Coach that rides on the Ops phone line and turns a tech’s morning check-in into alignment, accountability, and growth data.


AI OPERATIONS COACH — SYSTEM DESIGN
OBJECTIVE
Turn the technician Ops number into a daily coaching + accountability + growth engine that:
•	Aligns personal “WHY” → company mission
•	Tracks milestones & KPIs
•	Reinforces Gallup Strengths
•	Detects burnout, drift, or stagnation early
•	Removes managers from daily coaching labor
•	Compounds employee growth over time
•	
REALITY (FACTS & CONSTRAINTS)
•	Techs already call Ops early morning
•	Attention span: 60–180 seconds max
•	Must feel supportive, not surveillance
•	Needs structured data output (not just talk)
•	Must integrate later with HR, KPIs, reviews, comp
•	Bot must adapt per individual, not generic coaching
ASSUMPTIONS (flagged):
•	You can store per-tech profiles (strengths, goals, KPIs)
•	You control call flow via your AI API (VAPI / 8x8 / etc.)
•	Odoo or Sheets can act as the “brain” initially
STRATEGY

✅  Layered Micro-Coaching System (RECOMMENDED)

CORE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
1️⃣ TECH PROFILE (STATIC, SET ONCE)
Stored in DB / Sheet / Odoo:
•	Name
•	Role
•	Start date
•	Gallup Strengths (Top 5)
•	Personal WHY (1–2 sentences)
•	Current 90-day goal
•	Primary KPI focus (1–3 max)
This is the lens the bot uses to coach.

2️⃣ DAILY OPS CHECK-IN FLOW (60–120 sec)
Trigger:
Tech calls Ops number → recognized by phone ID
STEP 1 — Human Anchor (10 sec)
“Good morning [Name]. Before we start — quick check-in.”
STEP 2 — Health Scan (20 sec)
•	Energy level (1–5)
•	Any blockers today? (Yes/No → voice note if yes)
👉 Red flags auto-tagged
STEP 3 — KPI Alignment (20 sec)
Bot references their KPI:
•	“Yesterday you focused on ___”
•	“Today, what’s your top execution priority?”
Stored as:
•	KPI_focus_today
•	Confidence_level
STEP 4 — Strengths-Based Coaching (20 sec)
Bot uses Gallup profile:
Examples:
•	Responsibility → “Finish what you start today”
•	Achiever → “What does ‘win’ look like today?”
•	Harmony → “Any friction to avoid?”
This is not random motivation — it’s mapped.

STEP 5 — Micro-Commitment (10 sec)
“What’s one action today that moves you closer to your 90-day goal?”
Logged as:
•	Daily_commitment

3️⃣ WEEKLY MILESTONE LOOP (AUTOMATED)
Once per week, bot shifts mode:
•	Progress vs goal (%)
•	KPI trend (up / flat / down)
•	Time investment self-check
•	Burnout indicator
If thresholds hit → auto-flag manager only then
EXECUTION PLAN
•	OpenAI / OpenRouter

Deliverables:
•	Tech profile table
•	Morning call flow script
•	Data logging
•	Manager alert rules

Intelligence Layer
•	Adaptive prompts
•	Strengths-based coaching rules
•	KPI trend analysis
•	Auto-generated weekly summaries
Autonomy & Scale
•	No daily manager involvement
•	Bot recommends: 
•	Training
•	Schedule changes
•	Incentive nudges
•	Feeds into reviews & comp

FAILURE POINTS & MITIGATION
RiskMitigationTechs feel monitored so Frame as personal growth tool
Too long Hard-cap calls at 2 minBad data
Use structured promptsOver-coaching1 focus per day max
Manager overload Alert only on thresholds 

•	Too long → enforce hard cap, cut goal question first
•	Tech resistance → “Ops-only mode” reduces friction
•	Garbage answers → always re-prompt to “make it measurable”
•	Manager spam → only escalate on rules, not every note
Kill-switch: “Disable coaching prompts” → falls back to ops-only.

Kill-Switch:
One toggle disables coaching → ops-only mode instantly.

SCALE LOGIC (COMPOUNDING)
Daily check-ins create a dataset you can use for:
•	performance reviews
•	training recommendations
•	early burnout detection
•	KPI coaching at scale
•	retention and culture (without managers doing daily emotional labor)
•	Each call → data
•	Each week → better coaching
•	Each quarter → stronger techs
•	Fewer managers needed
•	Higher retention
•	Better performance without micromanagement
This converts: Labor → Data → Intelligence → Margin

TOP 3 PRIORITIES (RIGHT NOW)
•	Define Tech Profile Schema
•	Lock Daily Call Script
•	Decide where data lives first

Bottleneck: Over-complexity
Fix: Start with 1 KPI + 1 Strength + 1 Goal per tech
KPIs (FOR THE SYSTEM)
•	Daily check-in completion %
•	Energy trend
•	KPI adherence rate
•	Goal progress velocity
•	Tech retention


Example and more details
Two-mode script:
•	Daily Check-In (default)
•	Ops-Only Fallback (if caller refuses coaching / is in a hurry)

EXECUTION PLAN — SCRIPT (READY TO IMPLEMENT)
Below is the exact voice script with branching logic, tone, and structured logging fields.

0) SYSTEM / PRE-FLIGHT
Voice: friendly, confident, fast.
If caller recognized (Caller ID match):
•	Use name + personalized fields.
If not recognized:
•	Quick identity capture → proceed in generic mode.
A) DAILY CHECK-IN MODE 

(DEFAULT)
1) Greeting + Time Box
BOT: “Good morning, {FirstName}. This is the HVAC-R Finest Ops Coach.
We’ll do a 90-second check-in and you’ll be on your way.”
LOG:
•	call_type = "daily_checkin"
•	tech_id
•	timestamp
2) Attendance Confirmation
BOT: “Are you checked in and ready to roll today? Yes or no.”
If YES → continue
If NO:
“Got it. What’s the reason: sick, family, vehicle, schedule, or other?”
LOG:
•	ready_status = yes/no
•	not_ready_reason = enum
ESCALATE RULE:
•	If not_ready_reason in (sick, family, other) 
•	→ notify manager + dispatcher

3) Energy / Readiness Scan (Fast)
BOT: “Quick pulse check. On a scale of 1 to 5, what’s your energy right now?”
If 1–2 (low): “Copy. Keep it simple today. I’ll help you focus on one win.”
If 3–5: “Perfect. Let’s turn that into results.”
LOG:
•	energy_level = 1..5
ESCALATE RULE:
•	If energy_level <= 2 for 2+ consecutive workdays → flag “burnout_watch”

4) Blockers (Binary + Optional Detail)
BOT: “Any blockers that could slow you down today? Yes or no.”
If NO: “Good. Clean runway.”
If YES: “Name it in one sentence.”
BOT (after detail): “Understood. I’m logging that and routing it to ops support.”
LOG:
•	blocker_present = yes/no
•	blocker_note = text (<= 180 chars)
ESCALATE RULE:
•	Always route blocker note to ops channel (Slack/SMS/email)

5) KPI Focus (One Lever Only)
BOT: “Today’s main focus is {PrimaryKPI}.
What’s your top action to move that KPI today? One sentence.”
If tech gives vague answer: “Make it measurable. Example: ‘close two tickets,’ ‘reduce callbacks,’ ‘sell one maintenance,’ ‘arrive on time all day.’ What’s yours?”
LOG:
•	kpi_focus = {PrimaryKPI}
•	kpi_action_today = text

6) Strengths-Based Micro-Coaching (10–15 sec)
BOT: “Based on your strengths — {TopStrength1} and {TopStrength2} — here’s today’s edge:”
Insert one of these micro-lines based on strengths (rules below). Then:
“Repeat back your focus in five words or less.”
LOG:
•	coach_prompt_used = strength_template_id
•	focus_summary_5_words = text
Strength Templates (pick 1)
Use these as the bot’s “library.”
(Your dev maps TopStrengths → template.)
•	Achiever: “Win the day by stacking small completions. Finish the first job clean.”
•	Responsibility: “Do what you said you’d do. Close loops before you start new ones.”
•	Competition: “Pick a scoreboard: callbacks, close rate, time-to-complete. Beat yesterday.”
•	Learner: “One skill today: ask one better question on every call.”
•	Relator: “Build trust fast: explain the plan before touching anything.”
•	Communication: “Be clear: diagnose, explain, confirm. No mystery steps.”
•	Analytical: “Slow down 10%. Verify readings before deciding.”
•	Harmony: “Prevent friction: set 
•	expectations early with dispatch and customer.”
•	Discipline: “Follow your checklist. Clean work beats fast work.”
•	Focus: “One target. Say no to distractions until that target is done.”
•	Woo: “Lead with warmth, then direct the call to the next step.”
•	Empathy: “Listen first, then solve. People relax when they feel heard.”
7) Goal Alignment (10 sec)
BOT: “Your 90-day goal is: {90DayGoal}.
What’s one thing you’ll do today that supports that goal?”
LOG:
•	goal_action_today = text
8) Close + Confirm + Exit
BOT: “Locked in. Your plan today is: {focus_summary_5_words}.
I’ll check your progress at end of day. Go win.”
LOG:
•	call_completed = true
•	duration_seconds

Optional: If you have EOD calls enabled:
•	schedule EOD reminder text/call
B) OPS-ONLY FALLBACK MODE (IF TECH IS IN A RUSH)
Trigger phrases:
•	“I’m busy”
•	“skip”
•	“not doing this”
•	silence x2
BOT: “Copy. Ops-only mode. Two quick questions.”
•	“Are you ready to roll? yes/no”
•	“Any blockers? yes/no — one sentence if yes.”
BOT: “Logged. Have a safe day.”
LOG:
•	call_type = "ops_only"
•	minimal fields above
