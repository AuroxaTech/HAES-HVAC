# Prompt Engineering Skills Rule

When editing **system prompts** (`doc/vapi/system_prompt_*.md`) or **Knowledge Base** files (`doc/vapi/kb/**`), you MUST follow the guidelines in the portable skills doc so prompts stay minimal and effective.

## What to do

1. **Read** `skills/PromptEngineeringSkills.md` (or the project path where it lives) before making prompt or KB changes.
2. **Apply** its guidelines:
   - Keep the system prompt **minimal**; put SOPs and long content in the KB.
   - Put **critical rules first** (STOP rule, prohibited phrases, safety); use short bullets.
   - **Do not duplicate** KB content in the prompt; reference it.
   - When adding behavior, prefer **KB first**, then tool descriptions, then a short prompt line only if critical.
3. **Avoid bloat:** Do not paste long procedures into the prompt. Add one short instruction or move content to KB.

## Quick checklist

- Critical rules at top, one idea per bullet.
- New procedures/SOPs → KB (or tool description), not the main prompt.
- Prompt only references KB and states when to use it.

For the full list of guidelines, see `skills/PromptEngineeringSkills.md`. That file is **portable** and can be copied to other projects for reuse.
